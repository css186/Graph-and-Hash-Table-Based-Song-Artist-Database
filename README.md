# Graph-and-Hash-Table-Based-Song-Artist-Database
This program is a graph and hash table based database for tracking relationships between artists and songs. All data structures were implemented from scratch.

### Introduction
This project is a simulated database for storing songs, artists information, and tracking relationships between them. The records stored inside are artist names and track names. The two main data structures used are a hash table and a graph.

**All data structures in this project were built from scratch. The only built-in container allowed is the static array**

Here is a breakdown of its components and functionality:

### Core Functionality
1. Data Management:
    *  Artists and songs are stored seperately into two hash tables, and there is a graph structure whose responsibility is to manage relationships between artists and songs.
    * The relationships are modeled as edges in a graph. If multiple songs were written by one common artist, they should be considered as a connected component.
    * Duplicate entries are not allowed.

2. Operations:
    * Insert: User can add artist/song entries, and the database will store and connect them together automatically.
    * Remove: User can delete entries, and the relationships will be adjusted accordingly.
    * Print: Entries stored inside or graph statistics(connected components) can be visible in console.

3. Graph Analysis:
    * Union-Find and BFS algorithms were both implemented to track connected components.
    * Reports:
        * Total connected components.
        * Largest connected component size.

### Key Components
1. Hash Tables (```Hash.java```)
    * Quadratic probing for collision resolution.
    * Dynamic resizing (doubles capacity when load factor exceeds 50%).
    * Tombstone markers were used for deleted entries to ensure searching works correctly.

2. Graph (```Graph.java```)
    * Graph was implemented using adjacency lists and backboned by a doubly linked list (```DoublyLinkedList.java```).

3. Controller (```Controller.java```)
    * Coordinates hash tables and graph operations.
    * Handles command execution (i.e. insert/remove.print).

4. Command Processing(```CommandProcessor.java```)
    * Parses input files with commands like:
    ```
    insert <artist><SEP><song>
    remove artist <name>
    print graph
    ```

5. Testing
    * Extensive test coverage and mutation tests were implemented.

### Program Invocation
The program will be invoked from the command line as: 
```java GraphProject {initHashSize} {pathOfInputFile}```
* The name of the program is GraphProject. Parameter {initHashSize} is the initial size for each of the two hash tables (in terms of slots).
* Correct and complete format of input files can be referenced within the ```solutionTestData``` directory.
